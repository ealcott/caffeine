# Predicting & Analyzing Caffeine Content of Starbucks Beverages

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starbucks/starbucks-menu 

I completed this project in Python Jupyter Notebooks. I cleaned the original dataset in starbucks_nutrition.ipynb and saved the clean dataset to 
starbucks_cleaned.csv. I used decision tree and random forest models, respectively, to predict caffeine content in Starbucks beverages 
based on nutrition label and beverage information.
